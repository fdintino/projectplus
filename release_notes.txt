h1. ProjectPlus Version 1.51

* Bugfix, seems to fix occasional TM crash when using git


h1. ProjectPlus Version 1.5

* Avoid horizontal scrolling in outline view
* Support for Root ahead/behind remote repository indicator for git

Note for other SCMs: to show the ahead/behind markers, binary or a file status with *SCMIconsStatusAhead* or *SCMIconsStatusBehind*. Add overlay images to the *Resources* folder named `<scmName>(Ahead|Behind).<ext>`.


h1. ProjectPlus Version 1.4

* Much enhanced git support:
** Works correctly in projects containing multiple git repositories
** Folder icons show modified status if any file inside was modified or deleted
** Folder containing repository root are marked
** Un-versioned Files are hi-lighted 
* Added icons for *SCMIconsStatusUnversioned* state

Note for other SCMs: to hi-light the repository root, make sure the folder returns a status that is binary or'd with the new *SCMIconsStatusRoot* state. Also add an overlay image named <scmName>Root.<ext> to the *resources* folder and add it to the projects resources. <scmName> is the string returned by the -scmName method, <ext> is any image extension recognized by the system.


h1. ProjectPlus Version 1.3

* Updated Subversion libraries to 1.6
* Preferences for default sorting options (thanks to Lakshmi Vya)

h1. ProjectPlus Version 1.2

* SCM Badges would not display in some cases
** When a project was saved in a directory other than the project root, badges would not display.
** Also fixes some other less common cases which would prevent badges from working.

h1. ProjectPlus Version 1.1

* Sidebar
** TextMate does not load plug-ins until after the application is finished launching, which was causing problems when launching by double-clicking a project file (the project would open without a drawer or pane). This is now handled gracefully, but projects opened in this way will always have the drawer as they are opened before ProjectPlus is loaded.
* SCM Badges
** Added support for Mercurial, Svk and Bazaar (these should be considered experimental – I don’t use them so please report issues)
** Hopefully more to come, based on demand and how easy they are to implement
** Since there are now quite a few, and some of them are expensive to have enabled (as all except SVN use shell execution), all of the SCM modules are disabled by default and you must selectively enable the ones you want
** Fixed a memory leak that could occur when using SVN badging
** Misc. performance improvements and bugfixes
* General:
** Added Sparkle for automatic updates to future versions
** Added an icon (thanks to Oliver Busch)
** Other miscellaneous tweaks and improvements
